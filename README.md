# nf-genetic-correlations
Nextflow pipeline to perform genetic correlations with GWAS summary statistics (LDSC and LAVA)

This Nextflow pipeline receives as input GWAS summary statistics (at least two datasets - restricted to EUR genetic ancestry, for now) and processes them to compute global genetic correlations using LDSC (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) and regional genetic correlations using LAVA (https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA).

DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

**1. Install**
<git clone ape4fld/nf-genetic-correlations>

**2. Inputs needed from user:**
   
a) GWAS summary statistics files 
  - In text format (e.g. .tsv, .csv, .txt, etc.)
  - Required columns present (in any order, but with exact same column name): "variant_id", "effect_allele", "other_allele", "beta", "standard_error", "p_value"

    Note: variant_id are expected to be rsIDs; optimized for harmonized summary statistics downloaded from the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).
  -  Other columns can be present and they will be ignored.
  -  Stored in /genetic_correlations/data/sumstats/

b) Metadata file
  - One file named 'metadata.txt' with the following column names (tab separated):
    "dataset", "filename", "N", "cases", "controls"
  - dataset = a short name for each dataset
  - filename = file name for each GWAS summary statistics file
  - N = total sample size; if it varies per variant one can use the max. N
  - Cases = number of cases (if continuous trait, set to NA)
  - Controls = number of controls (if continuous trait, set to NA)
  - Stored in /genetic_correlations/data/

c) LD reference files
   i) LD scores for LDSC: wget https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2
      Note: uncompressed and stored in /genetic_correlations/data/ld_reference/ (need to have a directory within named 'eur_w_ld_chr')
   ii) 1000 Genomes reference genotype data for LAVA (in PLINK format; select 'European'): https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA/blob/main/REFERENCE.md
      Note: uncompressed and stored in /genetic_correlations/data/ld_reference/ (need to have a directory within named 'g1000_eur')

**3. nextflow config file:**
This config file is customed to be run at Alliance Canada in BÃ©luga.
The user will need to modify:
- the parameters set up in the config file included here ('nextflow.config') to match the paths to their files.
- the apptainer path to the LDSC .sif image.
- the paths to the directories mounted to run apptainer.
- the Alliance Canada user ID (within process: clusterOptions = '--account=def-xxxxx')
